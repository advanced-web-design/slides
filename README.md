This repo contains all of the slides for DMD 2095.81 Advanced Web Design at UConn Stamford.

To view the slides, visit <http://advanced-web-design.github.io/slides>

## Instructors

This project was built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark). This allows me to author the slides in Markdown and quickly publish them to the web using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The super minimalist home page was built using the [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) Jekyll theme.

### To use this exact setup:

- Fork this repo
- Remove the contents of the `_posts` directory
- Author your slides in markdown and save them to the `_posts` dir
- Include the following yaml front matter at the top of each slide file:

```yaml
---
layout: slide
title:  "Great Scott!"
date:   2015-10-21
---
```

**Note:** To prevent Jekyll from rendering the slide markdown, save the files with a `.html` extension.
