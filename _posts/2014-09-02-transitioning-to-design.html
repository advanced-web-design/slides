Let's take what we know and begin putting it on paper.

> Design informs even the simplest structure, whether of brick and steel or prose.

# Step 1: Let's Synthesize What We Know

---

# What makes for a *bad* restaurant website?

---

# What makes for a *good* restaurant website?

---

# Let's find some examples of *good* restaurant websites.

Reminder: Don't just focus on aesthetics.

# Card sorting

Recommended reading: http://boxesandarrows.com/card-sorting-a-definitive-guide/

# What is card sorting?

> Card sorting is a method used to help design or evaluate the information architecture of a site. In a card sorting session, participants organize topics into categories that make sense to them and they may also help you label these groups.

# Together: Let's brainstorm content for the Geno's Pizza website

What chunks of content could *potentially* be found on our website?

# Step 3: Sketching our ideas

---

# Sketching shouldn't be scary

[You don't have to be good at drawing to sketch](http://xkcd.com/1029/)

---

# Why sketch?

- A story: paper tablecloths
- Allows you to explore ideas away from the screen
- Not limited by the constraints of technology
- Allows you to move through ideas quickly
- You don't feel bad when you throw an idea away (small investment in ideas)
- Aids communication of ideas to others
