# The request

Geno's Pizza is a local pizza place. It does pretty well, but with the growing nearby campus, they realize that they are not taking full advantage of the college crowd. The owner, Geno, has come to you to ask for your expertise in web design.

# Your first job:<br/> Interview the client

For this assignment, I'll be playing the client.

---

# Client interview steps
1. On your own, come up with 10-15 questions that you think are the most important things to know about this project.
2. If you are stuck for questions, check out this [Stakeholder Interview Template](http://www.uxapprentice.com/resources/stakeholder-interview-template/)
3. In a small group review the questions that each of you has composed. As a group select 5 to ask during class (you are welcome to ask additional questions after class or through email).

---

# Your second job:<br/> Research the users

1. Buddy up! (you'll be working with a partner on this)
2. With your partner, devise a list of 5-10 questions for your target demographic (:cough:college students:cough:)
3. Between now and next class, you need to ask those questions to at least 15 people in that demographic.

---

## Your Assignments for next class:

1. Complete your user interviews with **at least** 10 interviewees.  
2. Order *Don't Make Me Think*
