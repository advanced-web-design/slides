# What is a persona?

- A persona is depicted as a specific person but is not a real individual (it is based on the observations of many people) 
- Each persona represents people in the real world and enables the designer to focus on a manageable and memorable cast of characters, instead of focusing on thousands of individuals. 
- Personas aid designers to create different designs for different kinds of people and to design for a specific somebody, rather than a generic everybody.

(1) You don't "make up" personas, but instead discover them as a byproduct of your requirements investigation process.

# Alan Cooper's suggestions for writing effective personas

(2) Write specific personas: you will have a much greater degree of success designing for a single person. The "generic user" will bend and stretch to meet the moment, but your true goal should be to develop software which bends and stretches. Your personas should "wiggle" under the pressure of development.

(3) You want to know what the persona's goals are so that you can see what your system needs to do, and not do.
-Sometimes you want to identify negative personas, people that you are not designing for.
